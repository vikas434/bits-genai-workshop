        "Chemical Process Calculations is a very fundamental and hugely numerical course which serves as a basic introduction to the field of chemical engineering. It aims at inculcating systematic problem solving skills in students. It teaches one to solve various material balance problems with or without chemical reactions for single and multiple reaction groups. It includes further topics like bypass, recycle and purging during chemical reactions. It involves the use of thermodynamic tables, psychometric charts and basic thermodynamic principles. Furthermore, solving of material and energy balance problems simultaneously is done too. To ace this course, attending tutorial classes is a must. The problems and solutions discussed in tutorials are of extreme help throughout the course. Also, the professor expects a certain format of answering the problems which is also well taught in the tutorials. Lectures for this course are not a must but recommended. It is advised that you watch all lecture recordings and slides if available and understand the way of teaching of the professor. The book to this course is also very helpful. Before examinations and tests, glancing over and understanding the solved problems is quite helpful. If time permits, it is also recommended to solve and practice the end of chapter exercises, not all the questions but 2-3 of each type. Grading in this course is a bit harsh as in the solutions, either complete marks are given or zero. Its rare to get partial marks in a question if you have solved it partially correct. But scoring up till midsems is quite easy while compared to that, post midsems the course becomes tougher. So, try to maximize your scores in midsems and tutorial tests and not rely on compres to salvage your scores and grades. As such this course isn‚Äôt a pre-requisite to any future course but serves as a good base for fundamentals of chemical engineering. The material balance and energy balance methods are further required in other courses."

        "This is one of the most interesting courses in the semester. It is an introduction to the field of fluid mechanics. It mainly covers the basic principles of fluid dynamics and introduces one to fundamentals of basic fluid flow operations. The course deals with the basic principles of fluid flow analysis and behavior. It requires the recognition of basic meaning of pressure, density, viscosity, velocity fields etc. It also involves the applications of concepts like Reynold number, mass conservation, unsteady and steady state flows of fluids, buoyancy, shear stresses, viscous forces, laminar and turbulent flow, boundary layer concept, drag and lift. It then uses these concepts to explain fluid flow and behavior in chemical industry equipment and vessels. The course is taken by Mr. Pratik N. Sheth. The classes are quite interesting and engaging and it is advised to attend the lectures as well as tutorials to understand the course content thoroughly as the course comprises of mostly numerical and graphical solving. Practice previous year papers, solved examples and back exercises for preparation for midsems and compres. Sometimes same questions from old papers are given in the exam with just a little tweak or value changes. Slides and books are more than enough to understand and revise the contents. Tutorial tests are small and to the point of topics in syllabus and scoring good in them is easy. Also read and learn initial theories of each chapter because they are asked in the closed book section of exams. Grading for this course is generally good and fair to the students. You need to be average+ 50 to be on the safer side to receive an A grade which is quite achievable if you understand the numerical concepts and graphs. This course is pre-requisite for an elective Computational Fluid Dynamics which is an advanced and more diverse version of this course."

I personally attended Jitender Sir‚Äôs classes and solved his problem sheets which I felt were sufficient. You can solve additional problems from the textbook until you gain confidence and practice PYQs before exams. For evaluations, give the quizzes a couple of days of prep as they have(had?) a pretty high weightage and be complacent with the buffer at the beginning because, at least for us, the content involved in the final quiz was the most challenging."

        "Again, a very numerical based and contains tons of formulas. Involves learning of steady and unsteady state conduction, Fourier‚Äôs law, resistance in heat transfer, heat transfer in cartesian, cylindrical and spherical coordinates, insulations, convective heat transfer, analogy between momentum and heat transfer, condensation, radiation, heat exchangers, LMTD, NTU method, co current and counter current problems. Lectures for this course are recommended but not a daily must. Though be wary of the surprise lecture test factor which usually happens at the end of each chapter post midsems. Tutorials are recommended as the problems discussed in tutorials are sometimes as it is asked in tests. Slides are beneficial for exam preparations and it is recommended to get the book for the open book part and highlight and mark all the formulas in the book for easy reference during the exam. Previous year papers practice is a must as the pattern of questions is somewhat the same every year with few tweaks and changes. The grading for this course is like any other chemical numerical course and would seem mostly fair to everyone. Though there‚Äôs usually a very fine margin between A and A- so be careful:)."

        "A very tedious and mind occupying course in general. It includes introduction to mathematical modelling and problem solving, use of MATLAB for equation and problem solving, error propagation, linear programming, linear and polynomial regression, Lagrange, inverse and spline interpolation and Fourier approximation, numerical differentiation and integration, differential equations and its engineering applications. As I liked to call it, this course is basically mathematics IV :). Lectures for this course are a choice, if you have a good mathematical base, you can basically do the whole course through slides and practice from text book. The whole course is purely and totally numerical. MATLAB will be taught in class but not in that depth and just for the ease of calculation. It won‚Äôt be considered as an evaluative component as the course doesn‚Äôt have any lab components. For exam preparations, thoroughly go through slides, practice the solved examples in class and tutorials, practice the assignment sheets and solve PYQs. The scoring and grading pattern for the course is same as Heat Transfer totally."

        "Both a theoretical and numerical course. This is one of the most complex courses in the semester in terms of understanding and application. It includes introduction to materials for engineering, metal structures, ceramics and polymers, crystalline structures, correlation of structure to properties and engineering functions, phase diagrams, heat treatment, polymers and composites, corrosion, evolution of materials and criteria for material selection. The professor for the course is a strict one and likes work to be done meticulously and properly, lacking which you can face serious consequences and mark deductions. Be thorough with your work and style in this course and be on time with everything and be honest most of all. The classes and tutorials are hugely beneficial, especially the tutorials as the examples discussed are very good and helpful for tests. Also don‚Äôt miss tutorials as attendance is recorded for them and often lecture content is carried on in tutorials too. For exam preparations, practice PYQs and back exercises. Solve tutorial examples and questions and also practice back exercises of the text book. Grading in this course is very general and as expected from a theoretical+numerical course. Because this course has a lot of evaluative components in terms of assignments so try scoring maximum in those so that you don‚Äôt lag behind as tutorial tests are quite tough and you might not be able to solve them once or twice."

It includes molecular diffusion in fluids, mass transfer, absorption, distillation, extraction, leaching etc. There are various types and methods of the said topics which are explained in great detail. The lectures for the course are very tedious as the professor takes a lot of extra classes and the syllabus runs slow up till midsems but after that the speed is picked up in such a way that if you don‚Äôt stay updated with what‚Äôs going on in class, you will surely lag behind. Tutorial problems are very basic but not in accordance with what is asked in tutorial tests or exams. For exams and test, practice PYQs and practice solved exampled in the text book and the back exercises of each type of question too. Grading is very fair for this course and usually in accordance with how you have performed throughout the sem. It is a high scoring course so you need to do good in all evaluatives to ace this course."

Up until the midsems you don‚Äôt need to attend classes as much and everything can be done from slides, books and PYQs. But after midsems the content gets a bit complex so going to classes and tutorials is recommended. The scoring and grading are just like any other common course and is mostly fair to everyone for every grade."
