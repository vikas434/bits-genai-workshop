The recommended book (Vairam SRamesh SEngineering Chemistry, Wiley India, 2011) is very extensive, and lectures only cover like 45% of the material which is expected of you during examinations. There is a lot of material to learn because the course is completely closed book. Be regular with the reading of the textbook to not pile up just before exams. PYQs are important as they give an idea about important topics which you should focus on, like wastewater treatment is one of the most important topics. Strict checking and grading.

It aims at inculcating systematic problem solving skills in students. It teaches one to solve various material balance problems with or without chemical reactions for single and multiple reaction groups. It includes further topics like bypass, recycle and purging during chemical reactions. It involves the use of thermodynamic tables, psychometric charts and basic thermodynamic principles. Furthermore, solving of material and energy balance problems simultaneously is done too. To ace this course, attending tutorial classes is a must. The problems and solutions discussed in tutorials are of extreme help throughout the course. Also, the professor expects a certain format of answering the problems which is also well taught in the tutorials. Lectures for this course are not a must but recommended. It is advised that you watch all lecture recordings and slides if available and understand the way of teaching of the professor. The book to this course is also very helpful. Before examinations and tests, glancing over and understanding the solved problems is quite helpful. If time permits, it is also recommended to solve and practice the end of chapter exercises, not all the questions but 2-3 of each type. Grading in this course is a bit harsh as in the solutions, either complete marks are given or zero. Its rare to get partial marks in a question if you have solved it partially correct. But scoring up till midsems is quite easy while compared to that, post midsems the course becomes tougher. So, try to maximize your scores in midsems and tutorial tests and not rely on compres to salvage your scores and grades. As such this course isn‚Äôt a pre-requisite to any future course but serves as a good base for fundamentals of chemical engineering. The material balance and energy balance methods are further required in other courses."

It requires the recognition of basic meaning of pressure, density, viscosity, velocity fields etc. It also involves the applications of concepts like Reynold number, mass conservation, unsteady and steady state flows of fluids, buoyancy, shear stresses, viscous forces, laminar and turbulent flow, boundary layer concept, drag and lift. It then uses these concepts to explain fluid flow and behavior in chemical industry equipment and vessels. The course is taken by Mr. Pratik N. Sheth. The classes are quite interesting and engaging and it is advised to attend the lectures as well as tutorials to understand the course content thoroughly as the course comprises of mostly numerical and graphical solving. Practice previous year papers, solved examples and back exercises for preparation for midsems and compres. Sometimes same questions from old papers are given in the exam with just a little tweak or value changes. Slides and books are more than enough to understand and revise the contents. Tutorial tests are small and to the point of topics in syllabus and scoring good in them is easy. Also read and learn initial theories of each chapter because they are asked in the closed book section of exams. Grading for this course is generally good and fair to the students. You need to be average+ 50 to be on the safer side to receive an A grade which is quite achievable if you understand the numerical concepts and graphs. This course is pre-requisite for an elective Computational Fluid Dynamics which is an advanced and more diverse version of this course."

Up until the midsems you don‚Äôt need to attend classes as much and everything can be done from slides, books and PYQs. But after midsems the content gets a bit complex so going to classes and tutorials is recommended. The scoring and grading are just like any other common course and is mostly fair to everyone for every grade."

Think through and choose a topic which you find interesting yourself and know a little about. Stick to the format given by the instructor (very important). Senior reports might just be of different formats so keep that in mind. Read the slide of a particular section before typing it out. Reading slides of questionnaire is a must.
